    desc="GourmetAnalytics is a cutting-edge app designed exclusively 
    for restaurant managers seeking to elevate their culinary operations. 
    Our platform seamlessly integrates nutrition analysis into your daily workflow,
     revolutionizing how you manage and present your menu offerings.."
    respon="WHAT I HAD TO DO"
    descrespon="Seamlessly analyze the nutritional content of each recipe, 
     gaining a deeper understanding of the overall nutritional profile 
     of the entire menu.
     For that,  I had to conduct interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, and iterating on designs"

    urs = "USER RESEARCH SUMMARY"
    desc = "This user group confirmed initial assumptions about GourmetAnalytics users, 
    but research also revealed that many users wanted 
    a place to easily store their recipes and download them.
    On the other hand, many users were more mature and less confident with technology,
     so, making the app resourceful and easy to navigate was a challenge."
    painp = "PAIN POINTS"
    desc2 = "ACCESIBILITY: Not only the assistive technologies but adapting to the heavy amounts 
            of users who were not comfortable on their phones 
        FAST FLOW: We had to make an easy and fast paced user flow that could do the chores 
            on the go without spending too much time on the app 
        REPORTS: Creating the perfect report was difficult and it could vary from user to user."

    <section-3
    desc="Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper 
    ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes 
    would be well-suited to address user pain points. 
    Nevertheless, those are not the final structural designs."
    desc2 = "Early designs allowed for some customization, but after the usability studies, 
    I added more useful home page. I also revised the design so users see 
    their recipes when they first land on the screen.
    The second usability study revealed frustration with the user flow, especially on the screen. 
    To avoid confusion, I eliminated the nav menu, and added a message to inform 
    people of the stage they are in."

    <section-4 
    desc = " User Quote (Lee):
            This App is like having a secret weapon in the kitchen. 
            It breaks down the nutritional nitty-gritty without making things complicated. 
            Now, I can create menus that not only taste amazing but also keep our customers happy and healthy. 
            It's not just an app; it's a kitchen companion that every restaurant manager needs.

            From this amazing experience I can take this: While designing the app, I learned that the first ideas 
            for the app are only the beginning of the process, and probably, they are not the best. 
            Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app’s designs."
