# Portfolio-v1
Hello!! This is an ongoing project to make my expectacular portfolio!

I'm using LitElement to make the web components, so you will need to install it whether with node or directly importing it with "import {LitElement, html, css} from 'https://unpkg.com/lit-element/lit-element.js?module';". 

To see compile it with node, I am using the following version: v14.18.0. To do so, follow this steps:
 - nvm install 14.18.0
 - nvm run 14.18.0
With the web-dev-server.

Then:
 - npm run start
